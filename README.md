This is a prototype implementation of the DAO projection draft for extending RPL (a low-power routing protocol for Internet of Things). 
This project is based on Contiki-NG an open-source operating system. 

A screenshot of the dashboard (which is also aware of siblings) is demonstrated below:

Knowing the topology we can install the routes as demonstrated in the demo [Video](https://youtu.be/pRlA1fBRYsc) .
